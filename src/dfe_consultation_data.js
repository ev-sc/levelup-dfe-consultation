                <p class="CxSpFirst"><span><span><span>50. The focus in primary school should be on teaching the fundamental building blocks and characteristics of positive relationships, with particular reference to friendships, family relationships, and relationships with other peers and adults.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span>51. This starts with pupils being taught about what a relationship is, what friendship is, what family means and who the people are who can support them. From the beginning of primary school, building on early education, children should be taught how to take turns, how to treat each other with kindness, consideration and respect, the importance of honesty and truthfulness, permission seeking and giving, and the concept of personal privacy. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span>52. Respect for others should be taught in an age-appropriate way, in terms of understanding one’s own and others’ boundaries in play, in negotiations about space, toys, resources and so on. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span>53. From the beginning, teachers should talk explicitly about the features of healthy friendships, family relationships and other relationships which young children are likely to encounter. Drawing attention to these when they are encountered in a range of contexts should enable pupils to form a strong early understanding of the features of relationships that are likely to lead to happiness and security. This will also help them to recognise any less positive relationships when they encounter them. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>54. The principles of positive relationships apply as much online as they do offline especially as, by the end of primary school, many children will already be negotiating relationships seamlessly online and offline. When teaching relationships content, teachers should address online safety and appropriate behaviour in a way that is relevant to pupil's lives. Teachers should include content on how information and data is shared and used online, for example sharing pictures, understanding that many websites are businesses and how sites may use information provided by users in ways they might not expect.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span>55. Teaching about families requires sensitive and well-judged teaching based on knowledge of pupils and their circumstances. Families of many forms provide a nurturing environment for children. Care needs to be taken to ensure that there is no stigmatisation of children based on their home circumstances and needs, to reflect sensitively that some children may have a different structure of support around them, e.g. looked after children or young carers.</span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span>56. A growing ability to form strong and positive relationships with others depends on the deliberate cultivation of resilience and positive character attributes, or ‘virtues’, in the individual. Relationships Education is most effective when set in a school-wide context where resilience and virtues are actively developed, promoted and practised. This includes helping pupils to believe they can achieve, stick at tasks, work towards long-term rewards and persevere despite knocks. Positive virtues pupils should develop include honesty, integrity, self-control, courage, humility, kindness, forgiveness, generosity and a sense of justice. Schools should develop resilience and virtues in many ways, including by providing planned opportunities for young people to undertake social action, active citizenship ‎and voluntary service to others locally or more widely. Relationships Education also creates an opportunity to enable pupils to be taught about positive emotional and mental wellbeing, including how friendships can support our mental wellbeing.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span>57. Through Relationships Education (and RSE), schools can help prevent abuse and protect children, by teaching the knowledge they need to be safe and to report abuse, including emotional, physical and sexual abuse. For example, in primary schools, this can be done by focusing on boundaries and privacy, ensuring young people are taught that they have rights over their own bodies and know how to report concerns or seek advice. This should include understanding boundaries in friendships with peers and also in families and with others (both online and offline). These subjects complement Health Education and as part of a comprehensive programme and whole school approach, this knowledge can support safeguarding all children. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>65. The aim of RSE is to give young people the information they need to help them develop healthy, nurturing relationships of all kinds, not just intimate relationships. It should enable them to know what a healthy relationship looks like and what makes a good friend, a good colleague and a successful marriage, civil partnership or other type of committed relationship. It should also cover contraception, developing intimate relationships and resisting pressure to have sex (and not applying pressure). It should teach what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in relationships. This will help pupils understand the positive effects that good relationships have on their mental wellbeing, identify when relationships are not right and understand how such situations can be managed.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>66. Effective RSE does not encourage early sexual experimentation. It should teach young people to understand human sexuality and to respect themselves and others. It enables young people to mature, build up their confidence and self-esteem and understand the reasons for delaying sexual activity. Effective RSE also supports people, throughout life, to develop safe, fulfilling and healthy sexual relationships, at the appropriate time. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>67. Knowledge about safer sex and sexual health remains important to ensure that young people are equipped to make safe, informed and healthy choices as they progress through adult life. This should be delivered in a non-judgemental, factual way and allow scope for young people to ask questions in a safe environment. Many teachers use approaches such as distancing techniques, setting ground rules with the class to help manage sensitive discussion and using question boxes to allow pupils to raise issues anonymously. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>68. RSE should provide clear progression from what is taught in primary school in Relationships Education. Teachers should build on the foundation of Relationships Education and, as pupils grow up, at the appropriate time extend teaching to include intimate relationships. Alongside being taught about intimate relationships, pupils should also be taught about family relationships, friendships and other kinds of relationships that are an equally important part of becoming a successful and happy adult. This teaching should enable pupils to distinguish between content and experiences that exemplify healthy relationships and those that are distorted or harmful. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>69. Pupils should understand the benefits of healthy relationships to their mental wellbeing and self-respect. Through gaining the knowledge of what a healthy relationship is like, they can be empowered to identify when relationships are unhealthy. They should be taught that unhealthy relationships can have a lasting, negative impact on mental wellbeing. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>70. As in primary, secondary relationships education is most successful where teaching about positive relationships is underpinned by a wider, deliberate cultivation and practice of resilience and positive virtues in the individual.&nbsp; These should include believing you can achieve goals and sticking at tasks that will help you do so, even when the reward is distant or uncertain or you come up against challenges, honesty, integrity, self-control, coura­­­­­­­ge, humility, kindness, forgiveness, generosity, trustworthiness and a sense of justice. There are many ways in which secondary schools should support the development of these virtues, for example by providing planned opportunities for young people to undertake social action, active citizenship ‎and voluntary service to others locally or more widely.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>71. Pupils should be taught the facts and the law about sex, sexuality, sexual health and gender identity in an age-appropriate and inclusive way. All pupils should feel that the content is relevant to them and their developing sexuality. Sexual orientation and gender identity should be explored at a timely point and in a clear, sensitive and respectful manner. When teaching about these topics, it must be recognised that young people may be discovering or coming to terms with their sexual orientation or gender identity. There should be an equal opportunity to explore the features of stable and healthy same-sex relationships. This should be integrated appropriately into the RSE programme, rather than addressed separately or in only one lesson.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>72. It is recognised that there will be a range of opinions regarding RSE. The starting principle when teaching each of these must be that the applicable law should be taught in a factual way so that pupils are clear on their rights and responsibilities as citizens.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>73. Schools may choose to explore faith, or other perspectives, on some of these issues in other subjects such as Religious Education.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>74. Pupils should be well informed about the full range of perspectives and, within the law, should be well equipped to make decisions for themselves about how to live their own lives in the future, whilst respecting the right of others to make their own decisions and hold their own beliefs. Key aspects of the law relating to sex which should be taught include the age of consent, what consent is and is not, the definitions and recognition of rape, sexual assault and harassment, and choices permitted by the law around pregnancy. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>75. Grooming, sexual exploitation and domestic abuse, including coercive and controlling behaviour, should also be addressed sensitively and clearly. Schools may also want to address the physical and emotional damage caused by female genital mutilation (FGM), where support is available and that it is a criminal offence to perform or assist in the performance of FGM or fail to protect a person for whom you are responsible from FGM. As well as addressing this in the context of the law, pupils may also need support to recognise when relationships (including family relationships) are unhealthy or abusive (including the unacceptability of neglect, emotional, sexual and physical abuse and violence including honour-based violence and forced marriage) and strategies to manage this or access support for oneself or others at risk. Schools should also be mindful that for pupils who are or have experienced unhealthy or unsafe relationships at home or socially, the school may have a particularly important role in being a place of consistency and safety where they can easily speak to trusted adults, report problems and access support.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>76. Internet safety and harms should also be addressed. Pupils should be taught rules and principles for keeping safe online. This will include how to recognise risks, harmful content and contact, and how and to whom to report issues. Pupils should have a strong understanding of how data is generated, collected, shared and used online, for example, how personal data is captured on social media, understanding the way that businesses may exploit the data available to them.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>77. Some pupils are also exposed to harmful behaviours online, and via other forms of media, which may normalise violent sexual behaviours. A focus on healthy relationships and broader Relationships Education can help young people understand acceptable behaviours in relationships.</span></span></span></p>
